/*Create a function called threeSum that takes array of integers (array) as an input 
and finds 3 different elements (they might have the same value, they need to differ in index) 
in the array for which their sum is the smallest and then returns indexes of these 3 elements 
(either as an array or list) in any order.
Example cases:

threeSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
Should return [0, 1, 2], because 1, 2 and 3 adds up to the smallest number and these are their indexes.

threeSum([100, 450, 200, 5]);
Should return [0, 2, 3], because 100, 200 and 5 adds up to the smallest number and these are their indexes. */
